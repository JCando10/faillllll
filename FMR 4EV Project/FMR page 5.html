<h4>What to wear and use</h1>

<h5>
    As unrelevant as it may sound, what you wear, use or even the place you dance in can affect the performance, due to these factors being key during the progression and overall result of the dance being executed. Which is why
    here are some tips and recommended "must get" wether you are a beginner or more experienced dancer, even though they are only suggestions these pros and advices can really benefit the dancer in terms of efficiency and achievement.
</h5>

<h3>Clothing</h3>

    <h5>
    
Improper clothing can impact technique, precision, ability to grip the floor, and visibility. This is especially important to remember when performing group and partnering choreography. Each dress code is chosen so the dancer can move to the best of their ability and focus on their steps, not on what they are wearing.<br>    
    </br>Clothes - loose fitting clothes, leggings are great. Anything you can move freely in. Layers are always good to keep your body warm. Shoes - bare feet or contemporary half shoes or foot gloves (these help to protect the feet especially in more advanced classes).

    <u>
 
        Comfortable and breathable clothing: Opt for clothing made of breathable and stretchy fabrics like cotton, spandex, or polyester blends. Avoid anything too tight or restrictive, as you'll want to be able to move easily and comfortably.  Many of our dancers wear joggers.
Loose-fitting pants or shorts: Baggy pants or shorts are a staple in hip hop dance, as they allow for a full range of movement and give the dancers room to add their own style and flair.
Sneakers: Hip hop dance requires a lot of footwork, so it is important to wear a pair of sneakers that provide good support and traction. Look for sneakers with a non-slip sole and good ankle support.  Our Glossy Hip Hop Sneakers have been a staple for a while!
Tank tops or t-shirts: A tank top or t-shirt is a great option for hip hop dance class, as they allow for maximum arm movement and are comfortable to move in.
Accessories: If you want to add some personal style to your hip hop dance class look, you can accessorize with a baseball cap, bandana, or a pair of sunglasses.
Hair: It's important to tie your hair back so it doesn't get in the way when you're dancing. A ponytail or bun is a good option.
Remember, you'll be sweating, so make sure to wear comfortable clothes you don't mind getting a little bit dirty.

    <h3>Items</h3>

        <h5>

            <ul>
            <li>
                A dance bag. Bring a dance bag that you use exclusively for dance. It's too hard to re-use your school book bag for dance class. Instead, get a bag that you just use for dance and that way, you can keep all your dance supplies in there all the time, rather than having to constantly transfer them out for school.</li>
                <li>A water bottle. You should be drinking water regularly throughout your dance class so you stay hydrated. Your studio likely has a water fountain, which you can use to refill it as needed.</li>
                <li>snack. In addition to plenty of water, you'll need a snack too. Opt for something healthy, such as a piece of fruit and some trail mix.</li>
                <li>Gym towel. If you think you're going to get sweaty during dance class, it can be helpful to have a towel handy that you keep in your gym bag. Just make sure you wash it every so often so it's clean.</li>
                <li>A good attitude. When you first come to dance class, you might be intimidated. But if you're open to making friends and learning new things, you'll be having a blast in no time at all.</li>
